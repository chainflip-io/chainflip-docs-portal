## Broker Light RPC node

As of version `1.12.0`, to call the Broker RPC endpoints, you must run your own Broker Light RPC node. Operating a Chainflip light-RPC node is straightforward and resource-efficient.
The Broker light-rpc node is just a normal Chainflip node running in a specialized `--sync light-rpc` mode. Your Broker account key must be injected in the node's keystore to be able to expose the Broker RPC endpoints and submit extrinsics.

This `light-rpc` mode prunes older blocks and permits querying only recent blocks, significantly reducing disk space requirements compared to running a full node. The recommended minimum requirements for running a light-rpc node include:
* 2 vCPU
* 4 GB RAM
* 20 GB SSD

## Running the Broker light-rpc node using Docker

Reference setup and compose profiles: [chainflip-mainnet-apis](https://github.com/chainflip-io/chainflip-mainnet-apis)

### Setup

* Clone the `chainflip-mainnet-apis` repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chainflip-io/chainflip-mainnet-apis.git
cd chainflip-mainnet-apis
```

### Broker account key

> ⛔️ Please make sure you backup your keys. If you lose your keys, you will lose access to your funds. ⛔️

* If you have an existing Broker account key, copy it to the `./chainflip/keys/broker/signing_key_file` file. Please make sure that the key is in the correct location, otherwise it won't be properly injected into the node's keystore.

If you don't have a Broker account key, you can generate one using the following steps.

```bash
mkdir -p ./chainflip/keys/broker
docker run --platform=linux/amd64 --entrypoint=/usr/local/bin/chainflip-cli chainfliplabs/chainflip-cli:berghain-1.12.0 generate-keys --json > chainflip/broker-keys.json
cat chainflip/broker-keys.json | jq -r '.signing_key.secret_key' > chainflip/keys/broker/signing_key_file
```

### Funding the Account
> The minimum funding amount for registering as a Broker or LP role is technically 1 FLIP. However, we recommend funding your accounts with at least 5 FLIP to account for transaction fees.

Get the public key of the Broker account:
```bash
cat chainflip/broker-keys.json | jq -r '.signing_account_id'
```

* Head to the [Auctions Web App](https://auctions.chainflip.io/auction)

* Click "Register Node" and follow the instructions to fund the account

### Running the node
* Start a Broker RPC node and wait for it to sync:
```bash
docker compose --profile broker up -d
```

* View the logs to monitor sync progress
```bash
docker compose --profile broker logs -f
```

You should see something like this:

Make sure:
* To see that light-rpc mode is enabled in the logs. Log line similar to: `⚡  Light-RPC mode enabled`
* Broker key is properly injected and Broker RPC endpoints are enabled. Log line similar to: ` 🗝️ Broker key found in the keystore, enabling Broker-related RPCs`


* Wait until the node is synced before start making RPC calls. This should take around 2 minutes.

> 💡 Note: Your node is considered synced when you see logs similar to:
```log
node-with-broker-1  | 2025-10-30 11:49:55 🏆 Imported #10260723 (0x5d76…b3af → 0x93df…717b)
node-with-broker-1  | 2025-10-30 11:49:56 💤 Idle (8 peers), best: #10260723 (0x93df…717b), finalized #10260721 (0xb28f…247c), ⬇ 190.9kiB/s ⬆ 102.5kiB/s

```

* You can check the node's health and verify it is synced by using this RPC call:
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "system_health"}' \
    http://localhost:9944
```
You should a response showing that `isSyncing` is false, similar to:
```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"peers":8,"isSyncing":false,"shouldHavePeers":true},"id":1}
```

* To stop the node:
```bash
docker compose --profile broker down
```

### Interacting with the APIs

Now you can interact with the APIs using any HTTP or WS client. Here we use the `curl` and `wscat` commands.

#### Register the Broker account via RPC

```bash copy
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"broker_registerAccount"}' \
  http://localhost:9944
```

* For example, to open a private broker BTC channel :

<Tabs items={['curl', 'wscat']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash
        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"broker_open_private_btc_channel"}' \
        http://localhost:9944
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash
        wscat -c ws://localhost:9944 -x '{ "id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"broker_open_private_btc_channel"}'
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

* Subscribe to scheduled swaps. Note that subscriptions are only supported over WebSockets.
```bash
wscat -c ws://localhost:9944 -w 20 -x '{ "id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"cf_subscribe_scheduled_swaps", "params":{ "base_asset":{ "chain":"Ethereum", "asset":"USDT" }, "quote_asset":{ "chain":"Ethereum", "asset":"USDC" } }}'
```

## Migrating from Broker-API Binary

If you're upgrading from a previous version that used a separate Broker API binary service, the new Broker light-rpc mode provides a simplified architecture where all APIs are exposed directly onto the rpc node.
There are no additional steps that are required from your side because all the same endpoints are exposed on the rpc node. All you have to do is:

* Make sure that your Broker key is in the right location so that it can be properly injected into the node's keystore. Follow the steps in [Broker account key](#broker-account-key)
* Redirect all your bots or external services from the old binary port to the new light-rpc node port.

To give you a better idea of the new architecture, here is a visual comparison of the old and new architecture:

* Before version `1.12.0`, you needed to run 2 services: the Broker API binary and an RPC node. The signing key is injected into the Broker API binary's keystore.

* As of version `1.12.0`, the Broker and general RPCs are consolidated as part of the node itself. the signing key is injected into the node's keystore on startup.
