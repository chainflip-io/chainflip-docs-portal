## Broker Role

Brokers forward users' swap requests to the network, paying transaction fees on their behalf and potentially taking a commission for each swap. Successful brokers need to provide and market a swapping interface and ensure they are resistant to spam attacks. See our section on [brokers](/brokers/running-broker-api) for further information.

Brokers need to **register** their account for the Broker role to gain access to swap-related functionality.

### Prerequisites

Before registering, you need to:
1. **Create a State-Chain account** and generate keys
2. **Fund the account** with FLIP
3. **Set up a Light-RPC node** (recommended) to interact with the Broker API

For complete setup instructions, see the [Broker-light-rpc-node](/brokers/broker-light-rpc-node) page, which includes:
- Key generation steps
- Account funding via the Auctions Web App
- Docker-based Light-RPC node setup with Broker profile

### Register using [`chainflip-cli`](/protocol/chainflip-cli)

```bash copy
chainflip-cli broker register
```

Once registered, the account will have full access to broker-related actions through the [Broker API](/brokers/broker-api).

### Register via Light-RPC (RPC alternative)

```bash copy
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"broker_registerAccount"}' \
  http://localhost:9944
```

### Deregister using [`chainflip-cli`](/protocol/chainflip-cli)

In order to be able to redeem all remaining FLIP, Broker accounts must **deregister**. As a pre-requisite for de-registering, Brokers must ensure they have withdrawn all of their earned commission fees. Once this is done, the Broker API can be switched off and the account deregistered via the CLI:

```bash copy
chainflip-cli broker deregister
```
