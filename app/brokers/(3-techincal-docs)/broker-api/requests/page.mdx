## Broker-API Methods

### `broker_request_swap_deposit_address`

Parameters:
- `source_asset`: Source [asset](#assets).
- `destination_asset`: Egress [asset](#assets).
- `destination_address`: Egress [Address](#addresses).
- `broker_commission`: Broker Commission in basis points (100th of a percent or 0.01%). Broker operators can choose to charge a fee for the use of their endpoint, and can be set at any value from 1 basis point to 1000 basis points (0.01% - 10%).
- `channel_metadata`: (Optional) Json object with the [cross-chain messaging]((../advanced/cross-chain-messaging/cross-chain-messaging.mdx) metadata:
- `message`: Hex encoded call data used after the message is egressed.
- `gas_budget`: The amount of gas or compute units required by the user logic on the destination chain.
- `ccm_additional_data`: Hex encoded additional data for the cross-chain message. Should be an empty array except for [CCM Swaps to Solana](../advanced/cross-chain-messaging/sol-ccm.mdx#solana-ccm-additional-data).
- `boost_fee`: (Optional) Maximum accepted boost fee in basis points (100th of a percent).
- `affiliate_fees`: (Optional) Array of affiliate brokers (up to 5) `[{"account": <AccountId>, "bps": <number>}]`.
- `refund_parameters`: (Optional) [Minimum accepted price](../../swapping-basics#minimum-accepted-price-slippage-protection) for swaps through the channel as JSON object: `{"retry_duration": <number>, "refund_address": <address>, "min_price": <hex_string>}`. Where `retry_duration` is a number of blocks, `refund_address` is an [address](#addresses), and `min_price` is a [price](#price).
- `dca_parameters`: (Optional) DCA parameters for swaps through the channel as JSON object: `{"number_of_chunks": <number>, "chunk_interval": <number>}`. Where `number_of_chunks` is the number of "sub-swaps" to perform, and `chunk_interval` is the delay between them in number of blocks.

Where every affiliate broker is defined as follow:
```json
{
	"account": <AccountId>,
	"bps": <BasisPoints>,
}
```
The total broker fee is the sum of the `broker_commission` + all the `affiliate_fees`.

Return:

- deposit [address](#addresses).

### `broker_register_account`

Parameters:

None

Return:

- `null` if successful, otherwise an error.

```

### `broker_withdraw_fees`

Withdraw all accumulated fees for a given asset.

Parameters:

- `destination_address`: The [destination address](#addresses) to which the assets should be withdrawn.

Return:
- tx_hash: Hash,
- egress_id: [ForeignChain, Number],
- egress_amount: Amount,
- egress_fee: Amount,
- destination_address: [Address](#addresses),

Example input:

```bash copy

  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "broker_withdraw_fees", "params": {"asset": {"chain": "Ethereum", "asset": "ETH"}, "destination_address": "0xabababababababababababababababababababab"}}' | jq
```

    "egress_fee": 490000,
    "destination_address": "0xabababababababababababababababababababab"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

### `broker_mark_transaction_for_rejection`

Request an incoming transaction to be rejected. Only available for bitcoin. This call will always succeed, but the transaction will
only be refunded if it hasn't been witnessed on-chain yet. For un-boosted channels this means prior to 6 blocks confirmation, for boosted
channels its prior to 1 block confirmation, i.e. only while the transaction is in the mempool. Also, a broker can only mark transactions
going into its own deposit-channels for rejection.

Parameters:
- `tx_id`: The transaction id of the transaction to be rejected. Only bitcoin is supported, the transaction hash has to be specified as shown in
the example below. Also, note that the byte order of the hash is *in reverse* to the usual representation in bitcoin block explorers.

Return:
- Nothing if transaction was successfully marked for rejection, error message otherwise.

Example input:

```bash copy
curl 'http://localhost/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "broker_mark_transaction_for_rejection", "params": {"tx_id": {"Bitcoin": "0x736c159fec96ea84b8eceb49258019625a17e68ab981a3a674261e1df00a0482"}}}' | jq
```

Example output (success):

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": "null",
  "id": 1
}
```

### `broker_get_open_deposit_channels`

Parameters:
- `query`: Which deposit channels to take into account. Possible values are `Mine` and `All`.

Example input:

```bash copy

### `broker_open_private_btc_channel`

A private Bitcoin channel is a dedicated persistent deposit channel unique to a single broker.

Opening a private Bitcoin channel is a requirement for Brokers who wish to support [Vault Swaps](../advanced/vault-swaps/bitcoin.mdx) with Bitcoin as the source asset. This is a one-time operation and requires the Broker to post a bond of 100 $FLIP, meaning the Broker must maintain a balance of at least 100 FLIP. The bond will be unlocked once the Broker [closes the channel](#broker_close_private_btc_channel) again.

Note that even though the *channel* is considered persistent, the corresponding *deposit address* will change every Epoch.

<Callout type="info">
    Private Channels are *not* required unless the Broker wishes to support Vault Swaps with Bitcoin as source asset.
</Callout>

Parameters: None

Return: The channel ID (Number)

### `broker_close_private_btc_channel`

Close the private Bitcoin deposit channel. The bond will be returned to your free balance.

Parameters: None

Return: The channel ID (Number)
