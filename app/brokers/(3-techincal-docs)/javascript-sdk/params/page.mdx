### `fillOrKillParams`

The `fillOrKillParams` object sets two different types of slippage protection when initiating a swap.

1. [**minimum accepted price**](/protocol/swapping-basics#slippage-protection)
   This protects the swapper against price changes between a quote and the execution of a swap by setting a minimum accepted price.
   If the minimum price cannot be met with the available liquidity during the specified number of blocks,
   deposited assets will be refunded to the specified refund address.
2. [**live price protection**](/protocol/swapping-basics#slippage-protection)
   This protects the swapper from getting an execution price that significantly deviates from the global index price of the asset
   (as determined by an oracle) ensuring the LPs are offering competitive pricing. Similar to other slippage settings, the execution of the swap
   will be paused until an LP offers a price that is within the specified deviation or the swap deadline is reached - in which case the swap will be refunded.
   This setting is especially useful during longer DCA swaps where the price of the asset is moving in favor of the swapper.
   i.e the slippage tolerance will "follow" the global price of the asset. In case the price
   moves against the swapper, it will still execute as long as the execution price is above the minimum accepted price.

| Param                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |           Data type           |
| :---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------: |
| `slippageTolerancePercent`                      | The percent of slippage that is acceptable for the swap. The `estimatedPrice` field from the `quote` is used to calculate the minimum price for the channel. **This field must be left out when specifying a `minPrice`.**                                                                                           |           `string`            |
| `minPrice`                                      | Minimum accepted price for swaps triggered through the deposit channel. **This field must be left out when specifying a `slippageTolerancePercent`.**                                                                                                                                                                |           `string`            |
| `livePriceSlippageTolerancePercent` \(optional) | The percentage of deviation from the global index price that is acceptable for the swap to execute. If the deviation is exceeded, the swap will be refunded to the specified refund address. If not set, the default value from the `quote` will be used. Set the value to `false` to disable live price protection. | `string` `false` `undefined ` |
| `refundAddress`                                 | Address on the source chain to which the refund will be sent, if the minimum price cannot be met.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |           `string`            |
| `retryDurationBlocks`                           | Number of State Chain blocks after which a deposit is refunded, if the minimum price cannot be met. One State Chain block corresponds to 6 seconds.                                                                                                                                                                  |           `number`            |

Slippage tolerance can be specified by using the `slippageTolerancePercent`
property. `slippageTolerancePercent` must be a number between 0 and 100. This
percent is used together with the `estimatedPrice` of the quote to calculate a
minimum accepted swap price:

```ts
const minimumPrice =
  quote.estimatedPrice * (1 - Number(slippageTolerancePercent) / 100);
```

Alternatively, you can manually provide a `minPrice` value. The minimum price is
the ratio between the human readable destination amount and the human readable
source amount, e.g. `3500` for a swap from ETH to USDC if you want to receive
at least `3500` USDC per ETH after fees.

Live price slippage can be specified by using the `livePriceSlippageTolerancePercent`
property. It must be a number between 0 and 100. The default behavior is to use the recommended
value from the quote but can be overridden or set to `false` to disable live price protection.
If the quote does not have a recommended live price slippage tolerance, this setting is not
available for the asset pair and should NOT be set.

If either of the slippage tolerance properties are invalidated, the swap will be refunded to
the specified refund address. Refunds are subject to a broadcast fee on the source chain to pay for the
transactions sent by the Chainflip protocol. The boost or deposit fee paid will not
not be refunded.

<Callout type="warning">
  If overriding live price slippage protection - the tolerance should account
  for network fees and broker fees. For example, if the network fee is 0.1% and
  the broker fee is 1.5% - the live price slippage tolerance should be set to at
  least 0.25% to avoid refunds. The recommended value returned from the quote
  takes these fees into account.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Slippage tolerance is applied relative to the quoted price unlike live price
  slippage which is applied relative to the global index price. Prices are
  checked on the AMM level and do not include deposit or broadcast fees.
</Callout>

#### Example

```typescript copy
const fillOrKillParams = {
  refundAddress: "0xa56A6be23b6Cf39D9448FF6e897C29c41c8fbDFF", // address to which assets are refunded
  retryDurationBlocks: 100, // 100 blocks * 6 seconds = 10 minutes before deposits are refunded
  slippageTolerancePercent: quote.recommendedSlippageTolerancePercent, // use recommended slippage tolerance from quote
  livePriceSlippageTolerancePercent:
    quote.recommendedLivePriceSlippageTolerancePercent, // use recommended live price slippage tolerance from quote
};
```

### `ccmParams`

The Cross-Chain Messaging optional `ccmParams` object enables to pass a [Cross-Chain Message](/protocol/cross-chain-messaging/overview)
to a receiver contract/program on the destination chain.

| `gasBudget` (required)         | Gas budget for the call on the destination chain. This amount is the amount of gas or compute units required by the user logic on the destination chain. | `number`  |
