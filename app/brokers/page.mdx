## Introduction

A Broker, in the context of the Chainflip protocol, is an entity that facilitates the process of initiating a swap on behalf of end users via [Request Deposit Address](../javascript-sdk/swap-assets/request-deposit-address-v2.md "mention"). They provide an endpoint to interact with the State Chain, reducing the complexity of transactions and lowering gas fees.

Brokers forward users' swap requests to the network, paying transaction fees on their behalf and potentially taking a commission for each swap. Successful brokers need to provide and market a swapping interface and ensure they are resistant to spam attacks. See our section on [brokers](../running-a-broker/introduction) for further information.

## How Brokers work

1. Any _State Chain_ account can register as a Broker, and start submitting **Deposit Channel Request** extrinsics on users' behalf.
2. Once a _Deposit Channel_ is opened, a hash is returned and it can be verified using [Chainflip's Explorer](https://scan.chainflip.io/).
3. Brokers must pay a small transaction fee in \$FLIP for each extrinsic they submit and a "Channel Fee". This is to avoid spam and for network integrity reasons. **The suggested amount to fund the State Chain account is 10 \$FLIP**.

  The cost Brokers pay to open _Deposit Channels_ is **very** cheap. See the \$FLIP balance from [Chainflip's Broker](https://scan.chainflip.io/brokers/cFLRQDfEdmnv6d2XfHJNRBQHi4fruPMReLSfvB8WWD2ENbqj7) â€” used to power our Swapping app.

## How Brokers earn fees

Broker operators can choose to charge a fee for the use of their endpoint. This fee is denominated in basis points, where a basis point is defined as 1/100th of a percentile and limited to 1000 basis points (equivalent to 10%). This fee is taken from the deposit asset amount and credited to the Broker's account.

If you are a developer of wallets, aggregators or DEXes, you can [earn revenue](../../../concepts/swaps-amm/deposit-channels-and-brokers#broker-fees) by bringing volume to Chainflip's ecosystem.
