## Collateralisation & Liquidations (LTV & Liquidation Thresholds)

### Collateralisation and LTV

Chainflip Lending uses external oracle prices to determine loan collateralisation and liquidation thresholds. This prevents internal pool price movements from affecting loan safety. Because Chainflip supports only highly liquid assets, concerns often associated with oracle dependency are significantly reduced.

Collateral values are sourced from Chainlink feeds witnessed by the validator network across Ethereum and Arbitrum for redundancy. These oracle prices determine loan health through the Loan-to-Value ratio (LTV):

<div style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
$$
\text{LTV} = \frac{\text{Loan Value}}{\text{Collateral Value}}
$$
</div>

A minimum collateralisation level (maximum LTV) is required when creating a loan. Borrowers can freely add more collateral at any time. If a user maintains an excessively low LTV (high overcollateralisation), a gradually increasing Low LTV Penalty is applied. This discourages locking up unnecessary collateral that reduces system-wide economic security.

Chainflip supports multi-collateral accounts. The oracle value of all supported collateral assets is combined to determine total collateral value for LTV calculation.

### Oracle Safety Controls

To protect borrowers and the system:

- Liquidations halt if oracle prices become stale
- New loan creation halts while oracles are stale
- Borrowers may still repay, add collateral, or close positions during these pauses

Future versions will support additional safety mechanisms like taking internal prices into account.

### Auto-Collateralisation

Borrowers may enable auto-top-up, which uses free balance in the State Chain account in their asset of choice to automatically increase collateral when LTV approaches the soft liquidation threshold. Auto-top-up prevents liquidation as long as the borrower has sufficient available balance.

### Liquidation Overview

Chainflip performs liquidations directly through its own cross-chain DEX. This provides two major advantages over traditional lending platforms:

- Liquidations are non-binary: they occur gradually rather than all at once
- Execution is native: LPs fill liquidation orders directly, removing the need for external liquidators demanding steep discounts

Any LP on the Chainflip DEX can fill liquidation orders. There are no specialist liquidators.

Liquidations begin when LTV crosses soft or hard liquidation thresholds.

### Soft Liquidation

Soft liquidation is triggered when collateralisation drops below the soft threshold.

The protocol submits small DCA-style liquidation orders with a minimum price slightly below the oracle value using Live Price Protection (LPP). LPs compete to fill these orders at near-market rates.

Liquidation continues until:

- the loan becomes healthy
- the loan is fully repaid
- collateral is exhausted

Borrowers may also manually trigger soft liquidation to unwind a position and reclaim remaining collateral.

---

### Hard Liquidation

Hard liquidation activates if LTV falls below the hard threshold.

In this mode:

- liquidation chunks are larger
- oracle-indexed discount limits widen (up to 5%)
- orders are submitted more aggressively

Despite wider limits, LPs still compete on price, so execution generally remains close to market rates.

The maximum expected liquidation loss for borrowers is approximately **5% of the loaned asset**, similar to Aave.

### Insufficient Collateral and Socialised Losses

If collateral cannot fully cover the loan after liquidation — an extremely rare scenario — losses are socialised among lenders of **that specific asset only**. Other assets and markets remain unaffected.

Historical behaviour across major liquidation events (e.g., Oct 10th 2025) suggests the Chainflip DEX can process such scenarios with minimal systemic impact.
