## Core Concepts

### Native Cross-Chain Custody
Chainflip Lending is built into the existing Chainflip cross-chain infrastructure.
When users deposit assets from their native chains into the Chainflip system, their funds are held in Vaults on the native chain, controlled by the decentralised validator network through a 100-of-150 threshold signature scheme.

See the
**[Protocol Overview](https://docs.chainflip.io/protocol/protocol-overview)** and
**[Vault System](https://docs.chainflip.io/protocol/vaults/bitcoin-vault-design)**
for more details.

### Permissionless Lending Architecture
Using this core vault and State Chain infrastructure, Chainflip enables the permissionless creation of loan positions for both suppliers and borrowers.
All positions, state transitions, health checks and liquidations are executed on the Chainflip State Chain.

### Isolated Markets & Account-Wide Liquidations
Each lending market is isolated per asset.
Activity in the BTC pool does not affect the USDC or ETH pools.

However, **liquidations are account-wide**:

- All collateral and debt in a borrower’s State Chain account contribute to one combined LTV.
- If this LTV breaches a threshold, the system liquidates **all loan positions in the account**, not just one.

Per-loan liquidations are **not supported** in this version.

### Deposit & Withdrawal Behaviour
Deposits and withdrawals are permissionless and instant, except in rare cases where the system activates protective pauses such as:

- oracle feed staleness
- extreme volatility
- system safety checks

These pauses lift automatically when conditions return to normal.

### Shared Infrastructure With the Chainflip DEX
Lending is part of Chainflip’s core State Chain logic and inherits:

- consensus safety guarantees
- vault-level TSS/MPC protections
- cross-chain event tracking
- deterministic execution
- Live Price Protection (LPP) behaviour

The lending engine and DEX share the same settlement environment and security model.
