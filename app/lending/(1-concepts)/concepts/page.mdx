## Concepts and Roles

### Core Concepts

#### Native Cross-Chain Custody
Chainflip Lending is built into the existing Chainflip cross-chain infrastructure. When users deposit assets from their native chains into the Chainflip system, their funds are held in Vaults on the native chain controlled by the decentralised network through a 100 of 150 threshold signature scheme.
See Protocol Overview for more details.

#### Permissionless Lending Architecture
Using this basic building block, Chainflip Lending adds a range of features to allow for the permissionless creation of loan positions for both lenders and borrowers.

#### Isolated Markets & Loan Positions
Each lending market is isolated per asset. Activity in the BTC pool does not affect the USDC or ETH pools.
However, liquidations are account-wide, not per-loan.
All collateral and debt in a borrower’s State Chain account contribute to one combined LTV. If this LTV breaches a threshold, the system starts liquidating all loan positions in the account until it becomes healthy again.
Per-loan liquidations are not supported in this version.

#### Deposit & Withdrawal Behaviour
Deposits and withdrawals are permissionless, with temporary pauses only during oracle failures or system safety checks. These pauses automatically resolve when safe conditions return.

#### Shared Infrastructure With the Chainflip Swapping DEX

Lending is part of Chainflip’s core State Chain logic and inherits the same
[consensus rules, safety guarantees, and TSS/MPC vault protections](https://docs.chainflip.io/protocol/egress-broadcasting-funds#egress-broadcasting-funds)
as the DEX itself.
