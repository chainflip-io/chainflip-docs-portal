## Liquidations

## Liquidator Role
There is no external “keeper” role in the traditional sense. The Chainflip DEX itself acts as the liquidation engine.When a position breaches soft or hard thresholds, the state chain submits protected orders into the DEX using LPP. Soft liquidation creates near-market, continuously repriced orders (for example, oracle minus ~0.2%) intended to unwind risk with minimal impact and maximal borrower surplus returned after settlement. If collateralisation falls below a hard threshold, the engine widens the permitted discount dynamically (for example, starting around 1% and, if needed, stepping towards ~5%) to guarantee fill. Because settlement occurs against in-protocol liquidity—augmented by CLL capacity—the system can intervene earlier and less punitively than off-venue keeper models, which typically require large fixed premiums to ensure participation.
