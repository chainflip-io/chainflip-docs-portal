## Supplying and Borrowing

### Supplying Assets
Chainflip Lending offers supply pools for supported assets. Liquidity suppliers deposit assets (most commonly USDC or USDT) into these pools, which are then made available to borrowers.

All supply activity is per-to-pool: users lend to a collective pool, not to individual borrowers. Interest and fees generated by borrowing activity are accrued to the pool and automatically increase each supplier’s share of the pool over time. No manual claiming is required, yields auto-compound.

Suppliers use their Chainflip State Chain account to deposit assets directly from any supported EVM wallet. Deposited funds begin earning yield immediately based on pool utilisation and interest accrual.

Supply-side risk is isolated per asset. Supplying USDC exposes the user only to USDC borrower risk and cannot be impacted by the behaviour of other markets.

### Borrowing Assets
Borrowers deposit collateral, typically BTC or ETH, but any supported collateral asset may be used, into their Chainflip State Chain account. This collateral can then be used to open one or more loan positions.

Chainflip supports multi-collateral accounts, with loan health and liquidation behaviour determined using a per-account loan-to-value (LTV) ratio based on oracle prices.

All collateral and debt in a borrower’s State Chain account share a single account-level LTV. If that LTV crosses a liquidation threshold, the protocol begins liquidating all open loan positions in the account, not just one of them.

Auto-top-up is always enabled in the current version.

If a borrower’s LTV approaches the soft liquidation threshold, the system automatically uses any free balance in their State Chain account to increase collateral and restore loan health.
This reduces liquidation risk as long as sufficient free balance is available.

### Collateral Management
Borrowers can:
add collateral at any time
withdraw excess collateral when safe
partially repay loans
fully close positions
convert assets via the DEX before repayment or collateral addition (manual soft liquidation)

Minimum collateralisation rules apply at loan creation. Additional collateral can always be added later to improve loan health.
For multi-collateral setups, Chainflip combines the oracle value of all collateral to determine the account’s overall LTV.

### Borrowing Lifecycle
A typical borrowing flow:
1. Deposit collateral into the State Chain account
2. Open a loan in USDC, USDT, or another supported asset
3. Withdraw borrowed funds to any supported chain and wallet
4. Monitor loan health as market prices change
5. Repay partially or fully using funds held in the State Chain account
6. Withdraw remaining collateral once the loan is closed

Loan interest accrues in the borrowed asset and updates every 10 blocks. Lenders always receive interest in the asset they have supplied.

### Repayments
Borrowers may repay debt at any time using:
balance in their State Chain account
assets swapped internally on the Chainflip DEX prior to repayment

Repayment reduces outstanding debt and improves LTV. When the debt reaches zero, the position closes automatically and all remaining collateral becomes withdrawable.
