## Supplying Assets

Chainflip Lending offers supply pools for supported assets. Liquidity suppliers deposit assets — most commonly USDC or USDT — into these pools, which are then made available to borrowers.

All supply activity is **pool-based**, not peer-to-peer:
- Users lend into a collective pool.
- Borrowers draw liquidity from that pool.
- Interest generated from borrowing accrues proportionally to all suppliers.
- No manual claiming is required; yields auto-compound.

### How suppliers earn
- Suppliers deposit assets using their Chainflip State Chain account.
- Deposited funds begin earning yield immediately based on pool utilisation.
- Interest accrues continuously and increases each supplier’s pool share over time.

### Risk isolation
Each asset has an isolated lending market.

Supplying USDC exposes a user **only** to USDC borrower behaviour.
Events in other markets (e.g., ETH, BTC, SOL) cannot impact the USDC pool.
