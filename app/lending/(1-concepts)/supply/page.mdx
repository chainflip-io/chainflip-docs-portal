## Supply

TODO: copied from Aave docs

Supplying tokens to the Chainflip Protocol allows users to earn interest on their digital assets and utilise supplied tokens as collateral. When tokens are supplied, they are transferred to the Chainflip liquidity pool, a system of smart contracts that facilitates overcollateralised borrowing of tokens. In Chainflip, supplied tokens automatically accrue interest based on the current market supply rate. As the balance of supplied tokens increases, interest is accrued dynamically, reflecting the current rate allocated to suppliers.

Interest rates for supplied tokens are determined by the borrow utilisation rate, which measures the proportion of assets currently borrowed against the total supplied in the pool, and by governance parameters that can be adjusted through community decisions. These parameters, including collateralisation requirements and interest rates for suppliers and borrowers, are influenced by onchain inputs such as token balances, oracle prices, and the borrow utilisation ratio. As liquidity is supplied, borrowed, repaid, or withdrawn from the pool, the interest rates are updated accordingly.

## Supplier Role
A lender supplies assets into lending pools to earn yield from two sources: ongoing variable interest paid by borrowers (CGL) and intermittent clearance fees plus interest from short-term lines used by LPs (CLL). Supplied assets remain in Chainflip’s vaults and are never wrapped into third-party IOUs. Lenders bear standard money-market risks, including the socialisation of residual losses in extreme liquidation scenarios where collateral proves insufficient. The protocol retains a share of interest and lending fees as a network fee to compensate for economic security and operations; the remainder is distributed to lenders in their supplied asset.

## Withdrawals

TODO: copied from Aave docs

Chainflip lending Protocol allows suppliers to withdraw their supplied tokens, including accrued interest, as long as there is sufficient unborrowed liquidity in the reserve. The withdrawal amount is limited by the available underlying assets, and that the user’s ability to maintain a sufficient collateral ratio for their borrow position. Periphery contracts with features such as withdraw and switch, allow users to redeem their supplied liquidity in a different token, providing more options for efficient asset management.

When withdrawing with an active borrow position, it’s crucial to maintain a healthy collateralisation ratio to avoid liquidation. Reducing collateral can lower the health factor, increasing the risk of liquidation. To remain safe, after the withdrawal, the account must stay above the liquidation threshold parameters. Therefore, withdrawals require careful management and consideration of the overall borrow positions to avoid liquidation.
