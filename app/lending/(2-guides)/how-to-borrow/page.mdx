# How to Borrow

Borrowing on Chainflip requires **collateral**.

Before you can open a loan, the assets you want to use as collateral must be:

1. **Deposited** into your State Chain account
2. **Moved** into your **collateral balance** (a dedicated sub-account for securing loans)

Borrowing therefore works in three stages:

1. Deposit funds into your State Chain account
2. Transfer funds into your collateral balance
3. Open a loan against that collateral

Below is the full step-by-step process.

---

## 1. Connect Your Wallet

Start by connecting either:

- an **EVM wallet** (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.), or
- a **Polkadot.js wallet**

Connecting authenticates your **State Chain account**, where:

- balances
- collateral
- loans
- repayment logic

all live.

> Your connected wallet is **not** the wallet holding your collateral — it only authenticates your account.

---

## 2. Deposit an Asset (Required Before You Can Borrow)

To borrow, your collateral must first exist inside the Chainflip system.

### How to deposit:

1. Go to the **Deposit** section
2. Select the asset you want to use as collateral
3. Chainflip generates a **native deposit channel**
4. Send funds to the deposit address from any wallet or exchange
5. Once confirmed, your balance appears under **Balances**

This balance is **not yet collateral** — you must transfer it in the next step.

### Supported native deposit channels

- **BTC → Bitcoin**
- **ETH / USDC / USDT → Ethereum**
- **SOL → Solana**

> No bridging, no wrapping — all assets remain fully native.

## 3. Move Assets Into Collateral

Collateral is separate from your normal account balance.

Currently, you can only move assets into collateral **via the Borrow modal**.

### Steps:

1. Open the **Borrow** modal
2. Click **Add Collateral**
   - This opens the *Transfer Funds* modal
3. Select the asset from your account balance
4. Enter the amount to move
5. Confirm

Once moved, the asset becomes **collateral** and can be used to secure a loan.

### Important:

- Your **first time borrowing** requires adding collateral before opening a loan
- Collateral remains fully native and secured in Chainflip’s **TSS vaults**

---

## 4. Your Primary Collateral Asset (PCA)

Your **Primary Collateral Asset (PCA)** is the preferred asset the protocol uses when:

- auto-top-ups trigger near liquidation thresholds (85%+ LTV)

Make sure your **account balance** has enough of your selected PCA to support top-ups.
You can change the PCA at any time.

---

## 5. Open a Loan

Once you have collateral:

1. Go to the **Borrow** section
2. Choose the asset to borrow (e.g., USDC, USDT)
3. Choose the loan amount or select the appropriate LTV
4. Confirm the loan

### After confirming:

- Borrowed funds appear in your **State Chain account balance**
- They can be withdrawn at any time
- Interest accrues **every 10 blocks**, denominated in the borrowed asset

---

## 6. Withdraw Borrowed Funds to Any Chain

Borrowed funds can be withdrawn natively:

- **USDC / USDT → Ethereum**
- **BTC → Bitcoin**
- **SOL → Solana**

Withdrawals are executed through Chainflip vaults.

---

## 7. Manage Your Position

At any time, you can:

- Add more collateral
- Repay loans partially or fully
- Swap assets inside the State Chain account before repaying
- Withdraw excess collateral (as long as LTV remains healthy)

Your LTV updates **every block** based on oracle prices.

---

## 8. Repay Loans

You can repay using assets in your **State Chain account balance**.

Once your debt reaches zero:

- The loan closes automatically
- All remaining collateral becomes withdrawable
