# How to Supply

## 1. Connect Your Wallet

To begin supplying assets, first connect either:

- an **EVM wallet** (e.g., MetaMask, Rabby), or
- a **Polkadot.js wallet**

Connecting a wallet creates and controls your **Chainflip State Chain account**.

> This does **not** pull assets from your wallet — it only authenticates your account.

## 2. Deposit Assets Into Your Account

Before you can supply to a lending pool, you must first **fund your State Chain account** (same flow used by Boost / LPs today).

1. Navigate to the **Deposit** section in the app.
2. Choose the asset you want to use for lending (e.g., USDC, USDT, BTC, SOL).
3. Chainflip will generate a **native deposit channel** for that asset:

   - **USDC / USDT →** deposit channel on **Ethereum**
   - **BTC →** deposit channel on **Bitcoin**
   - **SOL →** deposit channel on **Solana**

4. Send funds to the deposit address from **any wallet or exchange**.
   - You do **not** need to connect the wallet that holds the funds.
   - Once the deposit confirms, the balance appears inside your **State Chain account**.

After the deposit arrives, your **account balance** is ready to be supplied into the lending pool.

## 3. Supply to a Lending Pool

Once your balance is visible:

1. Navigate to **Lending → Supply**
2. Choose the asset you deposited
3. Enter the amount you want to supply from your **State Chain account balance**
4. Confirm the transaction

The supplied amount moves from **your account balance → the lending pool**.

## 4. Begin Earning Yield

Once you have supplied assets:

- Your deposit becomes part of the **lending pool**
- **Yield accrues only when borrowers create loans**
- Interest distribution updates **every 10 blocks**
- Incentives (if active) may still accrue even when utilisation is zero
- You can withdraw at any time (outside rare safety pauses)

Supplying is permissionless and requires no additional setup.
