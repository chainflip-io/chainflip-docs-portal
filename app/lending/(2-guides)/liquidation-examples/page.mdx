description: Realistic soft and hard liquidation walkthroughs

## Example 1: Partial (Soft) Liquidation

A user borrows 100,000 USDC using 1 BTC as collateral.
Initial LTV: 80%.
Soft and hard liquidation thresholds: 90% and 95%.

BTC drops to $110,000 → LTV rises to 91% → soft liquidation triggers.

### Soft Liquidation Process

- Liquidation splits into 10 × 0.1 BTC chunks
- Each chunk swapped with 0.5% live price protection
- LP competition typically executes swaps near market rate

First chunk:

- 0.1 BTC swapped for 10,980 USDC
- 5 bps liquidation fee applied (~5.5 USDC)
- Remaining 10,974.5 USDC repays loan

Debt after first chunk: 89,025.5 USDC
Collateral: 0.9 BTC
LTV: 89.9%

Soft liquidation continues until LTV falls below the “stability margin.”

Second chunk executes → debt 78,051 USDC → collateral 0.8 BTC → LTV 88.7% → liquidation stops.

Soft liquidation protected the position with minimal impact.


## Example 2: Hard Liquidation

Continuing from the earlier example (after the first chunk's execution):

- Debt: 89,025.5 USDC
- Collateral: 0.9 BTC

BTC drops to $104,000 → LTV = 95.1% → hard liquidation triggers.

### Hard Liquidation Process

- Live price protection widens to 5%
- Larger chunks sold
- Priority shifts to execution speed

0.8 BTC swapped over several executions:

- ~79,200 USDC recovered
- 5 bps fee applied (~39.6 USDC)

Debt: 9,865.1 USDC
Collateral: 0.1 BTC
LTV: 94.9%

Final chunk sold, loan fully repaid, and remaining USDC returned to the user.

## TL;DR

- Chainflip liquidations are **incremental**, **automated**, and **fair**
- Soft liquidation = gentle unwind
- Hard liquidation = emergency mode
- System gives many chances to top up or repay before selling collateral
