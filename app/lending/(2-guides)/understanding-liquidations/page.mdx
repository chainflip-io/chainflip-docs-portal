## What is a soft liquidation?

Soft liquidation is the first response when your LTV crosses the liquidation threshold.

- Triggered automatically
- Executed in small chunks through DCA-style swaps
- Uses tight live price protection (0.5%)
- Executed through DCA-style swaps
- Automatically aborts if LTV improves during the process
- May be escalated to hard liquidation if LTV gets worse

Soft liquidation protects your position while minimising loss.

## What is a hard liquidation?

Hard liquidation occurs when LTV becomes dangerously high, meaning soft liquidation was not enough.

In a hard liquidation:

- Trigger threshold is higher
- Live price protection widens to 5%
- Executed in larger chunks through DCA-style swaps
- Execution prioritises speed
- Automatically deescalates to soft liquidation (or compeletely aborts) if LTV improves

Hard liquidation is designed for extreme market conditions.
