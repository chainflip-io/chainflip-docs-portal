## What is a soft liquidation?

Soft liquidation is the first response when your LTV crosses the liquidation threshold.

- Triggered automatically
- Only a portion of collateral is sold
- Uses tight live price protection (0.5%)
- Executed through DCA-style swaps
- Abortable if LTV improves during the process

Soft liquidation protects your position while minimising loss.

## What is a hard liquidation?

Hard liquidation occurs when LTV becomes dangerously high, meaning soft liquidation was not enough.

In a hard liquidation:

- Trigger threshold is higher
- Live price protection widens to 5%
- Larger chunks of collateral may be sold
- Execution prioritises speed
- Still abortable if LTV improves

Hard liquidation is designed for extreme market conditions.
