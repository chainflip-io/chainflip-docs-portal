## How do liquidations work in Chainflip?

When your loan becomes undercollateralised:

- The protocol initiates liquidation DCA swaps, which convert part of your collateral into the loan asset (e.g., USDC or USDT) one chunk at a time
- The proceeds are used to repay part of your loan
- If the liquidation restores your LTV to a healthy level, the process automatically stops
- Unsold collateral (minus fees) is returned to your collateral account

Chainflip supports both **partial** and **full** liquidations depending on LTV and market volatility.

## What does over-collateralised mean?

Chainflip Lending is an over-collateralised lending system, you must deposit more in collateral than the value of your loan.

This ensures:

- Loans remain safely backed
- The protocol can recover funds through liquidation
- Users and lending pools are protected from insolvency

## What is Loan-to-Value (LTV)?

LTV measures how much you've borrowed relative to your collateral's USD value.

Example:
Borrow 20,000 USDT with $100,000 BTC collateral → **LTV = 20%**

If LTV exceeds the protocol’s liquidation threshold, your position may be partially liquidated.


## When does liquidation happen?

Liquidation occurs automatically when LTV exceeds the threshold, which can happen due to:

- A drop in collateral price (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
- An increase in the borrowed asset's price
- Accrued interest increasing debt

Before liquidation, Chainflip attempts **auto top-up** using your primary collateral asset.


## Can I avoid liquidation?

Yes. You can:

- Enable auto top-up (uses free balance of your primary collateral asset)
- Manually add more collateral at any time
- Repay part of your loan
- Monitor LTV in the app (with warnings when LTV is at risk)

Liquidation only occurs if no corrective action is taken.


## What happens after liquidation?

After liquidation:

- Liquidated value repays part (or all) of your loan
- A small liquidation fee (e.g., 5 bps) on the liquidated amount is deducted
- Remaining collateral is returned
- You retain control of the loan if it wasn’t fully repaid

Chainflip’s liquidation system is automated, incremental, and designed to minimise losses.


## What is a soft liquidation?

Soft liquidation is triggered when collateralisation drops below the soft threshold.

The protocol submits small DCA-style liquidation orders with a minimum price slightly below the oracle value using Live Price Protection (LPP). LPs compete to fill these orders at near-market rates.

Liquidation continues until:

- the loan becomes healthy
- the loan is fully repaid
- collateral is exhausted

Borrowers may also manually trigger soft liquidation to unwind a position and reclaim remaining collateral.


## What is a hard liquidation?

Hard liquidation occurs when LTV becomes dangerously high, meaning soft liquidation was not enough.

In a hard liquidation:

- Trigger threshold is higher
- Live price protection widens to 5%
- Larger chunks of collateral may be sold
- Execution prioritises speed
- Still abortable if LTV improves

Hard liquidation is designed for extreme market conditions.
