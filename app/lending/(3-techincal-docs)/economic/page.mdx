## Economic Security & Governance

Chainflip Lending does **not** introduce a new trust or security model.

It inherits the same guarantees used by the Chainflip DEX:

- Assets stay in native-chain vaults secured by the 100-of-150 TSS/MPC validator set
- All lending logic executes on the State Chain runtime
- Liquidations use the same cross-chain DEX infrastructure
- Risk is isolated per asset
- Governance and emergency controls work exactly as documented in the main protocol

If you want a deeper explanation of validator incentives, TVL limits, governance controls, Safe Mode, or the full economic security framework, refer to the core documentation:
