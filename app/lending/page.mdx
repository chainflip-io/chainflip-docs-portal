## Introduction

### What is Chainflip Lending?

Chainflip Lending extends the existing Chainflip cross-chain infrastructure with permissionless, overcollateralised lending and borrowing. Users can supply and borrow assets natively using BTC, ETH, SOL, or other supported assets as collateral, all without wrapping, bridging, or leaving their native wallet environment.

Deposited assets are held in Chainflip Vaults using a 100-of-150 threshold signature scheme. Borrowers can then create loan positions to borrow USDC, USDT, or other supported assets, and withdraw them directly to any wallet.

See the **[Protocol Overview](https://docs.chainflip.io/protocol/protocol-overview)** and the **[Vault System](https://docs.chainflip.io/protocol/vaults/bitcoin-vault-design)** for more details on native custody.

The lending market uses a utilisation-curve interest model similar to established DeFi lending protocols such as
**[Aave](https://aave.com/docs)** and **[Morpho](https://docs.morpho.org/get-started/)**, and leverages Chainflip’s existing cross-chain swapping infrastructure to manage and process liquidations in the event of a default.

For more background on the underlying system architecture, see
**[System Overview](https://docs.chainflip.io/protocol/protocol-overview#system-overview)**.

## Who is this for?

### Borrowers
Users who want to unlock the underlying value of their crypto assets while maintaining full exposure to the upside of their holdings — without triggering a sale.

**Example:**
A user has 1 BTC and takes out a 50,000 USDC loan to invest or cover real-world expenses, while keeping BTC upside exposure throughout the loan.

### Yield Seekers
Users supplying stablecoins or other supported assets to earn yield driven by borrower demand, protected by overcollateralisation and liquidations executed directly via Chainflip’s native cross-chain DEX.

### Liquidity Providers
All Liquidity Providers in the Chainflip trading system can benefit from profitable liquidation trades in their usual course of business in the cross-chain JIT AMM market.

### Integrators
Partners utilising the Chainflip SDK and related tools can offer these in-app lending and borrowing opportunities to their users and collect a share of the fees — enabling a seamless multichain DeFi experience.

## What does over-collateralisation mean?

Over-collateralisation ensures that every loan remains safely backed by more collateral value than the amount borrowed.
This protects lenders, stabilises markets, and provides borrowers with predictable liquidation behaviour.

Chainflip uses external oracle prices (e.g. Chainlink) to determine the value of collateral across chains.
All collateral in a borrower’s State Chain account contributes to a single combined LTV used to judge loan health.

## LTV and LTV ratio

The **Loan-to-Value ratio (LTV)** expresses how healthy a loan is:

- **Low LTV** → loan is safe and well-collateralised
- **High LTV** → loan approaches liquidation thresholds
- **Too high LTV** → liquidation begins, automatically or gradually

Because Chainflip uses a multi-collateral model, all supported collateral assets inside the account contribute to a single combined LTV.

Borrowers can add collateral, withdraw excess, partially repay, or close positions at any time.

## Lending Pools

A lending pool is a Chainflip market instance that enables users to participate as suppliers or borrowers.
Supply and borrowing occur through overcollateralised positions secured by Chainflip’s vaults and State Chain logic.

Suppliers deposit assets (commonly USDC or USDT) into the pool. Borrowers draw liquidity from the pool using their deposited collateral.

Key properties:

- Pools are isolated per asset (e.g., USDC, USDT, ETH)
- Interest rates follow a utilisation curve
- Liquidations are executed directly through the Chainflip native DEX
- Yield auto-compounds — no claiming needed
- Risk does not spill into other markets

Parameter decisions balance liquidity demands, borrower incentives, and system safety.
