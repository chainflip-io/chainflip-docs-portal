## Introduction

### What is Chainflip Lending?

Chainflip Lending extends the existing Chainflip cross-chain infrastructure with permissionless, over-collateralised lending and borrowing. Users can supply and borrow assets using BTC, ETH, SOL, or other supported assets as collateral — all without wrapping, bridging, or leaving their native wallet environment.

Positions, interest accrual, and risk controls live on the Chainflip State Chain, while assets are held in Chainflip Vaults on their native chains. Interest rates are set dynamically by a utilisation curve so that borrowing costs rise as pool usage increases and fall when liquidity is abundant.

Prices used for health checks and liquidation triggers come from external oracles (e.g. Chainlink), witnessed by validators on multiple chains for redundancy.

See **[Protocol Overview](/protocol/protocol-overview)** and the **[Vault System](/protocol/vaults/bitcoin-vault-design)** for more background on native custody and system architecture.

## What does over-collateralisation mean?

Chainflip Lending only supports **over-collateralised** loans.
This means the value of a borrower’s collateral must always be **higher** than the value of the debt.

- If you deposit collateral worth **$100,000** and borrow **$50,000** USDC, your position is over-collateralised.
- If the value of your collateral falls or your debt grows, your Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio increases.
- If LTV crosses certain thresholds, the system will begin liquidating collateral to restore health.

Over-collateralisation reduces the risk that bad debt is left in the system and protects liquidity providers and lenders.

## LTV and LTV ratio

The **Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio** measures how large a loan is relative to the value of its collateral:

> **LTV = (Value of Debt) / (Value of Collateral)**

- A lower LTV means the position is safer (more collateral relative to debt).
- A higher LTV means the position is riskier and closer to liquidation.

Chainflip enforces:

- a **maximum LTV at loan creation** (you cannot open an unsafe loan), and
- **soft and hard liquidation thresholds** where the protocol begins to sell collateral to repay debt.

Borrowers can always add collateral, repay part of the loan, or close the position entirely to improve their LTV.

## Lending pools

A **lending pool** is a Chainflip market instance that enables users to participate as **suppliers** or **borrowers**.

- **Suppliers** deposit assets (e.g. USDC, USDT) into the pool. Their liquidity is made available to borrowers and earns yield based on utilisation and interest rates.
- **Borrowers** take out over-collateralised loans against assets such as BTC, ETH, or SOL, paying interest to the pool.

Each market has governance-defined parameters such as:

- which assets can be used as collateral or borrowed
- minimum collateralisation requirements
- liquidation thresholds and penalties
- interest-rate curve configuration

All accounting, interest accrual, and liquidation logic runs on the Chainflip State Chain, while execution of liquidations happens through the cross-chain DEX and JIT AMM. This design keeps funds in native assets, avoids wrapped tokens, and leverages existing Chainflip infrastructure for settlement and security.

## Quick start

To start using Chainflip Lending, users will typically interact with two main flows:

- **Supplying** – deposit stablecoins or other supported assets to earn yield from borrower demand.
- **Borrowing** – lock up assets like BTC, ETH, or SOL as collateral to borrow stablecoins without selling your crypto.

Below are entry points into each flow. The underlying pages can be expanded over time, but the navigation and cards are already wired:
