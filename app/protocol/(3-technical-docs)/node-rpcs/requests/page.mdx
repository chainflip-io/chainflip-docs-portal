### `cf_controlled_vault_addresses`

Returns all vault addresses currently controlled by the network.
This includes both static addresses, as well as those that are rotated each [epoch](/validators/validator-auctions-bonds-and-rewards#what-is-the-validator-auction).

By default a short explanation is provided for every address, describing how it's used by the network.

Parameters:

- `chain`: [Chain](/lp/lp-api/types#chain) (Optional). If provided, only vault addresses for that chain are returned, otherwise for all chains.
- `compact`: bool (Optional). If true, all explanatory fields are skipped. Useful if rpc is called as part of an automatic setup.
- `at`: Block Hash as string (Optional), defaults to the last block if not provided

Return:
- an object containing an array of objects for each chain:
```json 
{
    "Bitcoin": [..],
    "Ethereum": [..],
    "Arbitrum": [..],
    "Solana": [..]
}
```
A single entry looks like follows:
```json
{
    "name": "String",
    "address": "String (address)",
    "explanation": "String",
    "rotation_policy": "String",
    "next_predicted_rotation": "String (date and time)"
}
```
