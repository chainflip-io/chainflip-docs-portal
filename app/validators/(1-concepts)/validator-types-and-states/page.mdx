## Validator Types & States

This page is intended to explain what the different states of a Validator are possible in the Chainflip system, and what each of them means.

It is important to note that a Validator does not refer to just any node on the Chainflip State Chain network. In contrast to State Chain Client operators, who may be using them for [liquidity management](/protocol/just-in-time-amm-protocol), [running a Broker](/brokers/running-broker-api), or simply monitoring the State Chain for data, a Validator, a node **must also run the Chainflip Engine (CFE)** sidecar module and have **configured endpoints** for all external chains, as well as set their State Chain **account type** to Validator.

This page should help operators understand how to set their Validator state to participate in auctions and manage their system accordingly.
